## Week 1

Summary: The Ted Talk described the physical computing as the interaction between computers and people. Computers will take inputs from people and create things for people to interact with in return.

Quote: "What they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them."

Comment: I think a big issue that will continue to grow is the debate over how much control the government, large companies, and individuals should have over technology. We need regulations to prevent harm, but we also need the opportunties for open source hardware. Technology can have consequences, so the debate is over who has control of it.

Question: What is open source hardware?

## Week 2

### Context
Article 1: [The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World](https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/03/11/108875/the-internet-of-things-roadmap-to-a-connected-world/)

Summary: The article describes the concerns and benefits of increasing connectivity with technology. The article highlights some of the main issues that we should be worried about, such as system architecture agreements and standards. The author points out that we need ask ourselves the value of these technologies.

Quote: "Today, the IoT is an abstract collection of uses and products. It’s imperative that we establish paradigms for effective implementation and use."

Comment: I understand the author's point, but I worry that if we create too many universal standards that we will lose individuality and ownership of our own private spaces on the internet and in our gadgets.

Question: How would we ever even decide the most effective way to create a universal connection system?

Article 2: [The Internet of Things had a dirty little secret: its not really yours](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/7/12/12159766/internet-of-things-iot-internet-of-shit-twitter)

Summary: The article brings light to the concerns about the internet's takeover of household objects, gadgets, and things previously not connected to the online world. Targeted advertisements and short lifespans of gadgets are just a few of the issues revolving around the technology takeover. The companies that are selling the products need to make commitments to the consumers.

Quote: "My old devices were so dumb, but in hindsight, that was kind of charming. They didn’t do much, and perhaps that simplicity is really what we need."

Comment: I have many conversations about target ads with my friends, just because of how often I notice them. I think that the internet has gone too far. People are paying money for NFTs and buying property in the Metaverse where virtual reality replaces real life. While I enjoy being able to control my thermostat while I'm away from home, is coming home to a cold home really that much of an issue? There are people with a lot bigger problems in the world. I also get concerned about how much we rely on the internet. The GPS on my phone is so easy to use, but if my phone ever dies, I don't know how well I'd do with the paper map in my passenger side door.

Question: At what point does technology take over our lives instead of improving it?


### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->

1. Name of the experiment
    1. Text, photos, etc.
    1. Describe the most important thing you learned (to share in class)
    1. Write a quiz question (which we will discuss in class)

1. Experiement 1: Taste the Power!
    1. We did not get to lick the batteries in class, but I work in the Makerspace, so I tried it down there. It was not as exciting as I was expecting it to be.
    2. Resistance is measured in Ohms. Conductors have low resistance and insulators have high resistance.
    3. Quiz question: How do lie detectors work?

2. Experiment 2: Let's Abuse a Battery!
    1. We also did not end up doing this experiement in class, but I've done this in my physics class before. A very important thing to remember is that short circuits are dangerous, and you should only try this with alkaline batteries, not lithium.
    2. Chemical reactions inside a battery create electrical pressure, resulting in voltage. Current is measured in amps. You can use a water analogy to understand how circuits work. Think of water in a tube with a hole in the bottom that it can leak out through. The voltage is the pressure, or the height of the water level. The amperage is the flow out of the hole. The resistance is the size of the hole. A larger hole would cause less resistance because mroe amperage can flow through it, and vice versa.
    3. There are two types of current. DC (direct current) is what we will be working with in the class. It flows steady in one direction. AC (alternating current) changes from positive to negative and is used to supply electricity to homes. It can be very powerful and dangerous. The charging blocks you use to plug your phone into the wall convert AC to DC current.
    4. Quiz question: What might happen if you short circuit a car battery?

3. Experiment 3: Your First Circuit
    1.
