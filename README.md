## Week 1

### Context
Article 1: [The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World](https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/03/11/108875/the-internet-of-things-roadmap-to-a-connected-world/)

Summary: The article describes the concerns and benefits of increasing connectivity with technology. The article highlights some of the main issues that we should be worried about, such as system architecture agreements and standards. The author points out that we need ask ourselves the value of these technologies.

Quote: "Today, the IoT is an abstract collection of uses and products. It’s imperative that we establish paradigms for effective implementation and use."

Comment: I understand the author's point, but I worry that if we create too many universal standards that we will lose individuality and ownership of our own private spaces on the internet and in our gadgets.

Question: How would we ever even decide the most effective way to create a universal connection system?

Article 2: [The Internet of Things had a dirty little secret: its not really yours](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/7/12/12159766/internet-of-things-iot-internet-of-shit-twitter)

Summary: The article brings light to the concerns about the internet's takeover of household objects, gadgets, and things previously not connected to the online world. Targeted advertisements and short lifespans of gadgets are just a few of the issues revolving around the technology takeover. The companies that are selling the products need to make commitments to the consumers.

Quote: "My old devices were so dumb, but in hindsight, that was kind of charming. They didn’t do much, and perhaps that simplicity is really what we need."

Comment: I have many conversations about target ads with my friends, just because of how often I notice them. I think that the internet has gone too far. People are paying money for NFTs and buying property in the Metaverse where virtual reality replaces real life. While I enjoy being able to control my thermostat while I'm away from home, is coming home to a cold home really that much of an issue? There are people with a lot bigger problems in the world. I also get concerned about how much we rely on the internet. The GPS on my phone is so easy to use, but if my phone ever dies, I don't know how well I'd do with the paper map in my passenger side door.

Question: At what point does technology take over our lives instead of improving it?
